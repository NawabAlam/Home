        <h3>Photography</h3>
        <p>I❤️to take pictures of everything i found to be beautiful.
          I prefer using my mobile 📱 rather than camera 📷
          to capture something because its easy to carry and always in my pocket.
          Since childhood, photography fascinated me,
          whenever i step out and saw something worth remembring,
          i just take my phone and capture it for forever,
          whenever i feel frustrated, depressed, lonely,
          photography always pushes me to get out during that time
          and it feels like someone is screaming inside my head
          and saying to get up and pickup your 📱 mobile 📱 and go out
          and seek for your smile, like you used to be.

        <h3>Coding</h3>
        <p>I❤️coding since childhood, because I play games,
so I always wondered how this game is made and whenever i ask my elder brother how this game was made,
he always said that it is all about a bunch of coding lines.
Those words from my brother inspired me to become a programmer but over time,
I have gained a wealth of experience designing and developing web applications, so as of now i am a web developer.</p>
